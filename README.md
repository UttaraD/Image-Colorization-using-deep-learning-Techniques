Image Colorization using Auto Encoders and Generative adversarial networks
One of the most exciting applications of deep learning is colorizing black and white images. This task needed a lot of human input and hardcoding several years ago but now the whole process can be done end-to-end with the power of AI and deep learning.
Recoloring and restoring old photos are a painstaking process when done manually through some photo editing software. Coloring black and white images with deep learning has become an impressive showcase for the real-world application of neural networks in our lives.
Auto encoders and GANs are some of the techniques that provide solution for restoring and recoloring of old photos.
